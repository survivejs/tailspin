While preparing for the upcoming [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) (24–26.04) conference, you may have spent some time learning the [basics of the Finnish language](/blog/brief-guide-to-finnish-vol--1---basics-7f43f37d5017/). This time we’ll leap to advanced level — all done by using only a single phrase.

I’ll demonstrate you five quite common scenarios of daily life in Finland. And how we‘re able to survive from almost every situation by using a simple language rule called “kysymysliitepartikkeli” (“question suffix particle”).

#### If you’re having a presentation

Standing in front of a crowd may be a stressful situation. A situation where the speaker needs to break the ice and win the confidence of an audience. The easiest way is to test whether the microphone merely works by asking:

> “Kuuluuko?” (“Can you hear me?”)

And if the mic is on, the audience will reply:

> “Kuuluu!” (“Yes, we can!”)

#### If you’re having dinner

Manners on a dinner table in Finland follow the standard rules, but sometimes people get confused with all the utensils.

You may find yourself holding a fork and asking _“Where does this belong to?”._ Of course, a friendly waitress will help you by pointing the right place and replying _“Over here”_. And because you want to be polite as well, you can confirm his/her guidance by asking:

> “Kuuluuko?” (“Does it belong here?”)

And then the waitress will reply:

> “Kuuluu” (“Yes it does”)

#### If you’re having a small talk

When it comes to small talk, Finns love talking about two topics. The first one is the weather. The second one is any possible topic **while being in a sauna**.

You can approach a fellow Finn simply by asking _“How are you doing?”_. In 99% of the cases, he will reply _“I’m doing fine”_. Since you probably want to continue the conversation, you can ask another question:

> “Kuuluuko?” (“Really?”)

And because Finns always tell the truth by default, he’ll reply:

> “Kuuluu” (“Yes I am”)

> In 1% of the cases, you might get their life story as a response. So be careful when asking this question!

#### If you’re going too far with the conversation

You should be aware that Finns have strict personal space and some topics should not be discussed of at all.

A typical Finnish reaction is to shout: _“This is none of your business!”._ To show your concern, you’re allowed to push the conversation a little by replying _“It actually is”_. Doing this will get any Finnish person a bit confused, and they will ask:

> “Kuuluuko?” (“Oh, it does?”)

You have to keep a solid line and reply:

> “Kuuluu” (“Yes it does”)

#### If you’re playing a game

If you’ve ended up this far and fellow Finn wants to challenge you to a board or card game, you’re doing it very well.

It’s time to learn some additional Finnish. For instance, you hold a card with mystical illustration of a _moon bone_; you would ask _“What is this?”_. And the Finn will reply _“A moon bone”_. You will repeat the actual answer by asking:

> “Kuuluuko?” (“A moon bone?”)

And the Finn will repeat the answer:

> “Kuuluu” (“Yes, a moon bone”)

_The above is possible because “kuu” (moon) and “luu” (bone) can be combined into a single word “kuuluu” (moon bone) which happens to overlap with other usages._
